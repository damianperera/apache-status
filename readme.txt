ABOUT
  The default apache status shows you information about current Apache 
  activity. But these server-status pages are difficult to read.

  The pimped Apache status makes the Apache server status readable,
  sortable and searchable. 
  The pimped Apache status can merge the status of several servers
  that opens the possibility to identify the troubleshooter in a
  load balanced website much more easily. 
  Btw: I use the script to fetch the status from 8 servers.

  The output uses jQuery and the plugin datatable to search and
  sort the data.

      alias /server-status (see below)

     you want to monitor

     </Location> 
  3. Open http://localhost/apachestatus/ in your webbrowser.
  4. In ./conf/ directory: open config_user.php and setup the systems you want 
     to monitor. See config_default.php to see other thing you could override
